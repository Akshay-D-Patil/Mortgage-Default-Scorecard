# Mortgage-Default-Scorecard

The goal of the project is to build up a “scorecard” to predict mortgage defaults. The task is to build up an
econometric model that predicts the probability that given loan defaults. In this case, a logistic regression model
is used since the dependent variable, BAD_OVER_48_60 is a categorical variable. After selecting the model,
independent variables are stepwise selected and added to the model to increase the predictive performance of the
model. After developing the final model, an analysis is performed on out-of-sample data and is compared against
in-sample data.
